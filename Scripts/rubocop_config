#Config I hope to use and explanations for each style choice

# based on this article: https://www.viget.com/articles/just-use-double-quoted-ruby-strings

# situations so for the sake of consistency and because we use double strings a lot we are
# going to ignore that style choice and just stick to only using double quotes for strings!
