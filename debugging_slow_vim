The basic process is identifying what plugins are going slowly
and what is causing them to behave that way

To get a log (stored in profile.log of your working dir) of
what function calls are being made run the below commands
in vim

	:profile start profile.log
	:profile func *
	:profile file *
	" At this point do slow actions
	:profile pause
	:noautocmd qall!

profile.log will have formatted output showing what functions were
called while the log was running so to see anything useful you'll
need to trigger the plugin function calls you think are moving slow

often times things that work well in small files and file sets do
poorly in really big sets if you lower the amount of content that
is open or being searched often there are big performance increases
e.g opening a single project directory for ctrlp to search through,
     not opening a directory of projects that floods what it needs
     to index

Another crude and effective way to solve this is by replicating
the situation that caused things to slow down, turning off a suspect
plugin, and then triggering the problem to see if things have sped up
or not

Finally if the issue is still persisting it might be worth checking
online to see if anyone has encountered similar issues with any of
the plugins in your vimrc
