Unless the internet is out, in which case you're pretty screwed anyways, the archwiki is the goto for all things linux. Here are some pages relevant to configuring
x11 based window managers.

What is the difference between .xinitrc , .xsession, and .xsessionrc
-------------------------------------------------
Source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/281858/difference-between-xinitrc-xsession-and-xsessionrc , this answer is copied from there.

~/.xinitrc is executed by xinit, which is usually invoked via startx. This program is executed after logging in: first you log in on a text console, then you start the 
GUI with startx. The role of .xinitrc is to start the GUI part of the session, typically by setting some GUI-related settings such as key bindings (with xmodmap or 
xkbcomp), X resources (with xrdb), etc., and to launch a session manager or a window manager (possibly as part of a desktop environment).

~/.xsession is executed when you log in in graphical mode (on a display manager) and the display manager invokes the “custom” session type. (With the historical
display manager xdm, .xsession is always executed, but with modern display managers that give the user a choice of session type, you usually need to pick 
“custom” for .xsession to run.) Its role is both to set login-time parameters (such as environment variables) and to start the GUI session. A typical .xsession is...

#!/bin/sh
. ~/.profile
. ~/.xinitrc

~/.xsessionrc is executed on Debian (and derivatives such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.) by the X startup scripts on a GUI login, for all session types and (I think) 
from all display managers. It's also executed from startx if the user doesn't have a .xinitrc, because in that case startx falls back on the same session startup 
scripts that are used for GUI login. It's executed relatively early, after loading resources but before starting any program such as a key agent, a D-Bus daemon, 
etc. It typically sets variables that can be used by later startup scripts. It doesn't have any official documentation that I know of, you have to dig into the source to 
see what works.

.xinitrc and .xsession are historical features of the X11 Window system so they should be available and have a similar behavior on all Unix systems. On the other 
hand, .xsessionrc is a Debian feature and distributions that are not based on Debian don't have it unless they've implemented something similar.

.xprofile is very similar to .xsessionrc, but it's part of the session startup script of GDM (the GNOME display manager), so it's only read if you log in with GDM.

How is this being used in the (currently) working Arch install?
-------------------------------------------------

Currently only blackbox window manager is installed. It's X window based (which is why im writing this out lol) and therefore uses .xinit and .xinitrc when it loads.
There is currently no display manager, so that's all that needs to be worried about. 

Blackbox is great for starting out, but it will likely be replaced by another window manager like openbox, awesome, or i3 relatively soon. All of these are also X 
window based from what I can tell, so this and the other config files will hopefully help figure everything out.

What is .Xauthority and what does it do?
