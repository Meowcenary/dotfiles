Find And Replace Vim Style
---------------------------

A common problem in programming is needing to find some word
and then replace it with another word either across the entire
file or in certain instances.

# this might be good to move into a hotkey command / macro
To replace across the entire file run this:
    :%s/old_word_to_replace/new_word/g

:s is the substitute command, *I think* % is an argument saying within
the current file

To replace individual instances of a word follow this workflow:
    - search for the word or phrase you want to replace with '/' followed by the
        word to find e.g /this_is_an_example_search
    - hit 'n' or '*' to search down and 'N' or '#' to search back
    - at the first instance to replace, use 'cw' and then type the replacement
        word or phrase
    - search forward or back and then press '.' to repeat the replacement command
        on whatever word or phrase you're currently hovering over
