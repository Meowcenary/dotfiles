What is the purpose of etc/default?

/etc/default contains some parameters that the end user or administrator is likely to change, rather than embedding the values in the actual boot scripts.
In this way, changes will persist even if you upgrade the package and the boot script is replaced.

In debian, /etc/default/ is a directory of mostly empty files. The way it is meant to work is that each /etc/init.d/test script first sources /etc/default/test 
before starting/stopping the test service. The purpose of the file is to provide extra options for starting the service, or override certain aspects of the
service's startup.
