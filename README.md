.vimrc:
    uses vim-plug from here: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug , 
    it's pretty straightfoward to get plugins installed.

    mostly getting plugins from http://vimawesome.com/

.gitconfig:
    shortcuts for git. these are all lifted from other gitconfig files 
    that were shared with me
