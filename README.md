.vimrc:
    uses vim-plug from here: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

    mostly getting plugins from http://vimawesome.com/

   vim commands: :FixWhitespace , removes whitespace at end of lines
                 ctrl + a , comments out a section of code
                 ctrl + b , uncomments out a section of code

   *airline requires 'set laststatus=2' in vimrc to work*

   *syntastic requires a syntax checker*
   e.g for python using flake8
   check out the documenation online, dont bother with the vim command

.gitconfig:
    shortcuts for git. these are all lifted from other gitconfig files
    that were shared with me
