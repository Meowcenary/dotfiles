# the below command copies all directory names from a provided directory and then creates new empty directories
# with the provided names wherever the command is run

mkdir $(echo $file | ls -p ../path_to_directory_to_copy_structure_from/ | grep /$ | tr '/\n', ' ')

# As an example, running the below in the directory ~/Comics/NewMarvel
# mkdir $(echo $file | ls -p ~/Comics/Marvel/ | grep /$ | tr '/\n', ' ')
# would create the directory ~/Comics/NewMarvel/ with all the directories in
# ~/Comics/Marvel having empty copies here.
